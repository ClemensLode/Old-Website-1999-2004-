<B>Third Update, 3/2/02</B><BR>
<BR>
Oh, yes, the Neural Network project was very nice :) Though, comparing to the old approach (just a straight line of a linear build order) it didn't work quite well.<BR>
Now it's time to add a "user-friendly" interface (good that it's the only calculator availible, so there are not many competetors around ;)) and the other 2 races.<BR>
All in all the new version works fine, it only has some problems with Sunken and Spore Colonies.<BR>
The only other problem I have is the name... I researched the web and found a "Starcraft Build Calculator"... Well, perhaps something like SCEC-StarCraftEvolutionChamber.<BR> 
And now a little Goodie for all you SC-Players:<BR>
20 Hydra Drop, Speed/Range upgrade in around 10-11 minutes (Speed 5) calculated by the Calculator :P<BR>
-9 Overlord<BR>
-11 Extractor<BR>
-10 Spawning Pool<BR>
2 additional Drones<BR>
2 Drones -> gathering gas<BR>
1 additional Drone<BR>
1 Drone -> gathering gas<BR>
1 additional Drone<BR>
1 Hydralisk Den (14 Drones in that moment)<BR>
2 Overlords<BR>
9 Hydralisks<BR>
Upgrade Grooved Spines<BR>
Upgrade to Lair<BR>
4 Hydralisks<BR>
Upgrade Ventral Sacks<BR>
1 Hydralisk<BR>
Upgrade Pneumaticed Carapace<BR>
1 Hydralisk<BR>
Upgrade Muscular Augments<BR>
4 Hydralisks<BR>
1 Overlord<BR>
1 Hydralisk<BR>
Go Go Go :P<BR>
<BR>
I do not think that there are a much better way to get that fast these upgrades... <BR> 
Of course, you shouldn't use that on LT :P<BR>
I also would propose some spore colonies against early air attacks...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Second Update, 2/11/02</B><BR>
<BR>
Well :B<BR>
"zerg version is ready in about 1 or 2 weeks"... but after exchanged some ideas with the creator of "Stratagema", I decided to implement an evolving neural network would be much better, as it is a more generalized solution. I.e. you can apply the calculated network to more than just one problem...<BR>
Well, it *runs* but is in the moment way to slow and stuck too often in local minima...<BR>    
<br>



<BR>
<B>First Update, 12/30/01</B><BR>
<BR>
Well, I decided to restart the StarCraft Calculator project. The program is complete (except some major bugs I have to kill ;-) In addition it needs some more fine-tuning before I can present it here...) :)
It is only for Zerg build orders but I will type in the Terra and Protoss unit, building and upgrade stats soon.
I think the zerg version is ready in about 1 or 2 weeks (I "have to" spend my time to my new flatrate, a session and some other "more" important things ;-) ).<BR>   
<BR>
Oh and I updated the VOR Calculator. I uploaded the much slower debug-version instead of the fast release version.
(and I added Windows-support if you want to call it that way, it won't close immediately after the calculation is complete...)<BR>   
<BR>
I also noticed that the homepage need some more design, especially those midis and some new graphics.
Well... first things first, programming is more important ;-).<BR>
