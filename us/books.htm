And here some good books I read about AI:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Artificial Life</B> ("Kuenstliches Leben aus dem Computer") (Steven Levy)<BR>
<BR>
This is a VERY good introduction to Artificial Life giving nearly a complete overview.<BR>
It handles evolutionary and genetic algorithms, artificial life and finally robotics.<BR>
But don't expect too much of the book, it doesn't get into detail, no source code etc.<BR>
All in all it's for beginners or just people who are interested in Artificial Life.<BR>

<BR>
<B>Genetic Programming</B> (An Introduction)<BR>
<BR>
This book really goes into detail :). This book gives a good introduction into genetics and<BR>
possible ways to program it though it's kinda hard to understand if you are new to the subject.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The DEUS Machine</B><BR>
<BR>
Oh, it's (of course :P) a very interesting (sci-fi) novel about biological warfare and how nature itself fights against it.<BR>
The center of this war is a computer who gained self consciousness. <BR>
It plays in 2005 in USA after a worldwide recession when an underground organisation tries to take over high positions in the government.<BR>
