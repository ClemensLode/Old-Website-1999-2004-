This book is a very good introduction as it covers nearly the complete area of science of artificial life.

Especially the description of the course of development is very interesting.

"Jan Tenner" is a german radio play, it's setting is so called 'Westland' in the not so far future.
Together with 'Professor Futura', 'General Forbett' and the Professor's assistent 'Laura' they go through several adventures concerning aliens ('Leonen'),
traveling to the space and the depths of the ocean. Well actually they were everywhere after 46 cassettes ;-).
Science Fiction at its best - Jan Tenner.
There are also a new series which is FAR beyond the old classics... Well, they produced that probably for a much younger audience.

In my opinion the best series of Star Trek.<BR>
Though there are some bad episodes, there are many superior ones :)<BR>
In DS9 the characters have much more possibilites to develop as they are stationated and the episodes need no 'alien/planet/space monster of the week' ;).<BR>

<div id="Starcraft Broodwar" class="tooltip">
<B>StarCraft (Broodwar)</B><BR>
<font size=-1>(Blizzard)</font><BR>
Real time strategy at its best. Clearly no.1 in RTS since 1998.<BR>
It is relatively simple but a long way to master.<BR>
Choose between 3 races, gather resources, build your base up, attack the enemy.<BR>
What makes StarCraft so unique?<BR>
The 3 races are in gameplay and graphics COMPLETELY different and very good balanced.<BR>
There is no unit that is 'simply better than the others', you always need a certain unit type for special purposes. There are land and air units all with different armor and damage types, speed, shield, regeneration, etc etc...
Well, I played about 2000-3000 games until it become a little boring. (hehe)<BR>
As there is still a big StarCraft community (after 5 years!) you will find many players on the Battle.Net to challenge.

<div id="MoM" class="tooltip">

<B>Master of Magic</B><BR>
<font size=-1>(Microprose)</font><BR>
Well, in my opinion one of the best game ever :-).
Created 1995 it has of course not the best graphics but you can recognize everything with one blink (in contrary to Civilization...)<BR>
You can customize your personality by choosing virtues and spellbooks which represent your ability to master rare spells.<BR>
In addition you can choose between 15 races, nearly all with special units, buildings and additional virtues.<BR>
The game gets its final touch by the two worlds, a bright and a darkside (connected by heavy guarded magic portals), full of caves, ruins and magic nodes to explore and a roleplay system (experience, magic items, ...)<BR>
Age of Wonders (1 and 2) clearly tried to copy the system but hough AoW2 got much better graphics MoM is the best in gameplay.<BR>
Try to get over your first predijuces because of the (relative to today's standards) graphics, get into the spirit of the game and endless hours of gameplay are assured!<BR>
This game is a MUST if fantasy/strategy/build up/role play is your cup of tea.

Well it is not completed yet (release date: SOOON!!!) and I hope that it will be as great as its predecessor, Master of Orion 2.<BR>

<font size=-1>(Firaxis Games)</font>
<BR>
- round based strategy (like civ, but on another planet)<BR>
- 7 factions, not 7 races, each with an own character, goal, advantages and disadvantages. <BR>
It's like Civilization in space though there are many additions.<BR>
- You can design your own units<BR>
- barbarians are replaced by mind worms with unique rules<BR>
- <B>much</B> better diplomacy/AI<BR>
- better graphics and sound  <BR>
- many different ways of winning the game<BR>

<font size=-1>(Blizzard)</font>
<BR>
Ok... Playing on the Battle.net is addicting ;-) (see StarCraft) <BR>
But this game got ten times faster boring than StarCraft...<BR>
I wondered why... well, here is my statement:<BR>
- The first 5-10 minutes there is NO real interaction between you and your enemy. It is like a single player game.<BR>
- After that the armies will find each other and the first fight comes up. Well... the one who creeped better or have a better army-combination wins and have a significant advantage as he can creep further...<BR>
- Combat is really chaotic... They implemented 3D but you get no advantage of it :[.<BR>
- You need no build orders. I.e. every build up is like the other... you have not much choices.<BR>
- Poor damage/armor system... I think most of the units are similar (in meaning of gameplay).<BR>
...<BR>
Well... It's probably more a 2vs2 game while I am more a 1vs1 player... <BR>
Games make most fun (to me) when I can choose between many different ways to defeat the enemy...<BR>
In that point StarCraft is MUCH better.<BR>
The best thing in WarCraft III is the battle.net and the community.<BR>
Well if you like a more action-orientated RTS you are welcome to play WarCraft3.<BR>

Music<BR>

Well actually I hear any kind of music from peter gabriel, medwyn goodall to hammerfall and rhapsody ;-)<BR>
Depends in what mood I am or what I do...<BR>
Well here a list of my favorites:<BR>
<BR>

<div id="DeadD" class="tooltip">
<B>Dead can Dance</B><BR>
<BR>
Calm background music, some chants.
</div>
o <a onMouseOver="showInfo('DeadD');" onMouseOut="hideInfo('DeadD');">Dead can Dance</a><BR>

o Last Temptation of Christ<BR>
o Loreena McKennitt<BR>

<div id="Unic" class="tooltip">
<B>The Last Unicorn</B><BR>
<BR>
All those wonderful soundtracks from the great movie on CD.<BR>
Quite not the background soundtrack for action shooters ;-)<BR>
</div>
o <a onMouseOver="showInfo('Unic');" onMouseOut="hideInfo('Unic');">Last Unicorn</a><BR>

o Era<BR>
o Enya<BR>
<div id="Space" class="tooltip">
<B>Space Night</B><BR>
<BR>
Space Music :-)<BR>
Well it is not a certain music style but (in my eyes) a good collection of different artists.<BR>
</div>
o <a onMouseOver="showInfo('Space');" onMouseOut="hideInfo('Space');">Space Night</a><BR>

o Phillip Glass<BR>

o Oliver Shanti<BR>

<div id="Schiller" class="tooltip">
<B>Schiller</B><BR>
<BR>
Nice background music mixed with some two or three-liners from the famous german writer Schiller. 
</div>
o <a onMouseOver="showInfo('Schiller');" onMouseOut="hideInfo('Schiller');">Schiller</a><BR>

<div id="Vic" class="tooltip">
<B>Vic Fontaine</B><BR>
<BR>
Well, actually 'Vic Fontaine' is a hologram in the TV Series Star Trek:Deep Space 9 which sings in a computer generated bar of the mid-20th century songs like 'Come fly with me', 'I've got the world...' or 'That old black magic'.<BR>
Though there are many famous singer who recorded that chansons I prefer Vic because the songs remember me on my favourite tv-show :-)<BR>
Play 'Come fly with me' when you start your dropships/air assault fleet ;)<BR> 
</div>
o <a onMouseOver="showInfo('Vic');" onMouseOut="hideInfo('Vic');">Vic Fontaine</a><BR>
<div id="Basil" class="tooltip">
<B>Basil Poledouris</B><BR>
<BR>
Basil who?<BR>
Yes, the one who made the movie music for Conan, Conan II and Starship Troopers :-)<BR>
Great heroic music.<BR>
</div>
o <a onMouseOver="showInfo('basil');" onMouseOut="hideInfo('basil');">Basil Poledouris</a><BR>
<div id="Russia" class="tooltip">
<B>Russian Red Army</B><BR>
<BR>
Some pieces are a very good background music for army game where you have to lead large troups into battle :-)<BR>
</div>  
o <a onMouseOver="showInfo('Russia');" onMouseOut="hideInfo('Russia');">Russian Red Army</a><BR>

<div id="Chris" class="tooltip">
<B>Chris Huelsbeck</B><BR>
<BR>
Know Turrican? Then you know Huelsbeck :-)<BR>
He made the music for many other computer titles though he got quite quiet in the last years...<BR>
</div>
o <a onMouseOver="showInfo('Chris');" onMouseOut="hideInfo('Chris');">Chris Huelsbeck</a><BR>
<div id="Heavy" class="tooltip">
<B>Rhapsody, Hammerfall</B><BR>
<BR>
Well, every game needs a suitable background music :-)
So when your marines go into action you might also let the hammer fall ;)<BR>
Loud.<BR> 
</div>
o <a onMouseOver="showInfo('Heavy');" onMouseOut="hideInfo('Heavy');">Rhapsody, Hammerfall</a><BR>
