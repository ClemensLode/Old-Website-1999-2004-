Need a vacation?<BR>
Then do a perfect trip to Mars and come to Recall!<BR>
Pretty brutal in some parts, interesting story, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mars, Mutants.<BR>
What do you need more? :)<BR>
Two thumbs up!<BR>

<div id="Starship Troopers" class="tooltip">
<B>Starship Troopers</B><BR>
<BR>
On the one side it is a very good action movie (mankind fights against huge buglike creatures).<BR>
On the other side it is a good science fiction movie that critizes media, the army and human over-confidence on technical superiority.<BR>

<div id="Wishmaster" class="tooltip">
<B>Wishmaster</B><BR>
<BR>
After an accident an ancient ruby is discovered. It contains a 'djini' which grants any wish.<BR>
Of course always in the most cruel way...<BR>
Not for the lighthearted ;)<BR>
There are some sequels (II-IV) which are probably worth a try, too :).

<div id="Evil Dead" class="tooltip">
<B>Evil Dead II</B><BR>
<BR>
Sequel to 'Evil Dead - Dead by dawn'.<BR>
Splatter movie. Splatter and again splatter.<BR>
After reciting some passages in an old book the wood and the dead become alive...<BR>
Gather some friends in a little hut somewhere in the wilderness and watch that movie. Hehe.<BR>
Don't take the movie too serious... In my opinion it's the funniest movie ever :B<BR>

<div id="Fall" class="tooltip">
<B>Falling Down</B><BR>
<BR>
A man looses his job, he is divorced and it's the birthday of his child.<BR>
He wants to drive 'home' but he cannot because of high traffic.<BR>
So he gets out of his car walking through the city. And he is in no good mood.<BR>
Interesting movie about psychology of a man that has still some principles but has not much to loose.

<div id="Conan" class="tooltip">
<B>Conan the Barbarian</B><BR>
<BR>
Fantasy swordplay at its best :)<BR>
Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan, not much talking.<BR>
This is another MUST SEE.<BR>
Conan II is not as good (too much talking), 'Red Sonja' (something like a sequel to Conan II) is good though Arnold no longer represents Conan.<BR>

Well, nothing special except that nasty invisible alien creature slaying them one by one :)<BR>

Aah :)<BR>
This Japanese series is cult :).<BR>
See how Godzilla (and many other monsters) destroy Tokyo again and again and again ... *g*<BR>
Besides all that fiery breath and destruction, it is interesting how (over the course of the movies) Japan developes over time more and more improved weaponry against Godzilla :).<BR>

<div id="Starcraft" class="tooltip">
<B>StarCraft (Broodwar)</B><BR>
<font size=-1>(Blizzard)</font><BR>
Real time strategy at its best. Clearly no.1 in RTS since 1998.<BR>
It is relatively simple but a long way to master.<BR>
Choose between 3 races, gather resources, build your base up, attack the enemy.<BR>
What makes StarCraft so unique?<BR>
The 3 races are in gameplay and graphics COMPLETELY different and very good balanced.<BR>
There is no unit that is 'simply better than the others', you always need a certain unit type for special purposes. There are land and air units all with different armor and damage types, speed, shield, regeneration, etc etc...
Well, I played about 2000-3000 games until it become a little boring. (hehe)<BR>
As there is still a big StarCraft community (after 5 years!) you will find many players on the Battle.Net to challenge.

<div id="MoM" class="tooltip">
<B>Master of Magic</B><BR>
<font size=-1>(Microprose)</font><BR>
Well, in my opinion one of the best game ever :-).
Created 1995 it has of course not the best graphics but you can recognize everything with one blink (in contrary to Civilization...)<BR>
You can customize your personality by choosing virtues and spellbooks which represent your ability to master rare spells.<BR>
In addition you can choose between 15 races, nearly all with special units, buildings and additional virtues.<BR>
The game gets its final touch by the two worlds, a bright and a dark side (connected by heavy guarded magic portals), full of caves, ruins and magic nodes to explore and a roleplay system (experience, magic items, ...)<BR>
Age of Wonders (1 and 2) clearly tried to copy the system but hough AoW2 got much better graphics MoM is the best in gameplay.<BR>
Try to get over your first prejudices because of the (relative to today's standards) graphics, get into the spirit of the game and endless hours of gameplay are assured!<BR>
This game is a MUST if fantasy/strategy/build up/role play is your cup of tea.

<font size=-1>(Firaxis Games)</font>
<BR>
- round based strategy (like civ, but on another planet)<BR>
- 7 factions, not 7 races, each with an own character, goal, advantages and disadvantages. <BR>
It's like Civilization in space though there are many additions.<BR>
- You can design your own units<BR>
- barbarians are replaced by mind worms with unique rules<BR>
- <B>much</B> better diplomacy/AI<BR>
- better graphics and sound  <BR>

<font size=-1>(Blizzard)</font>
<BR>
Ok... Playing on the Battle.net is addicting ;-) (see StarCraft) <BR>
But this game got ten times faster boring than StarCraft...<BR>
I wondered why... well, here is my statement:<BR>
- The first 5-10 minutes there is NO real interaction between you and your enemy. It is like a single player game.<BR>
- After that the armies will find each other and the first fight comes up. Well... the one who creeped better or have a better army-combination wins and have a significant advantage as he can creep further...<BR>
- Combat is really chaotic... They implemented 3D but you get no advantage of it :[.<BR>
- You need no build orders. I.e. every build up is like the other... you have not much choices.<BR>
- Poor damage/armor system... I think most of the units are similar (in meaning of gameplay).<BR>
...<BR>
Well... It's probably more a 2vs2 game while I am more a 1vs1 player... <BR>
Games make most fun (to me) when I can choose between many different ways to defeat the enemy...<BR>
In that point StarCraft is MUCH better.<BR>
The best thing in WarCraft III is the battle.net and the community.<BR>
Well if you like a more action-orientated RTS you are welcome to play WarCraft3.<BR>

<B>Music</B><BR>
<BR>
Well actually, I hear any kind of music from Peter Gabriel, Medwyn Goodall to Hammerfall and Rhapsody ;-)<BR>
Depends in what mood I am or what I do...<BR>
Here is a list of my favorites:<BR>
<BR>

<div id="DeadD" class="tooltip">

Calm background music, some chants.

All those wonderful sound tracks from the great movie on CD.<BR>
Quite not the background soundtrack for action shooters ;-)<BR>

<div id="Vic" class="tooltip">
<B>Vic Fontaine</B><BR>
<BR>
Well, actually 'Vic Fontaine' is a hologram in the TV Series Star Trek:Deep Space 9 which sings in a computer generated bar of the mid-20th century songs like 'Come fly with me', 'I've got the world...' or 'That old black magic'.<BR>
Though there are many famous singer who recorded that chansons I prefer Vic because the songs remember me on my favorite TV-show :-)<BR>
Play 'Come fly with me' when you start your dropships/air assault fleet ;)<BR>
