<BR>As you can see, with 10 buttons you have some problems with team assignment but on the other hand you can produce
15 Hydras all over the map with one click :)

<div id="whatsthat" class="tooltip">
<B>Hu? The Claw? What's that!?</B><BR>
<BR>
Well... it is a so called 'game controller', simply said a 'handy' keyboard.<BR>It is no mouse, it stands still on 4 plastic feet.<BR>
If your fingers are not very short (well... 'The Claw' is about 19cm long) 'The
Claw' will lie perfect in your hand.<BR>
The buttons have a good press-point so you normally will not hit a button accidently.
</div>
- <a onMouseOver="showInfo('whatsthat');" onMouseOut="hideInfo('whatsthat');">Hu? The Claw? What's that!?</a><BR>

<div id="details" class="tooltip">
<B>Technical details</B><BR>
<BR>
- 'The Claw' has 10 Buttons and is connected to your computer via USB<BR>
- The Windows software supports 4 shift buttons so you have (4 + 1 (no shift)) * 6 = 30 Functions. Besides all possible key combinations you can even assign mouse clicks and delays.<BR>
- Under Linux 'The Claw' reveals additional power, thanks to a programmer who wrote a basic software which can be configured individually.<BR>
Currently I am writing on an Update which will support StarCraft much better than now.<BR>
- It weighs about one pound.
</div>
- <a onMouseOver="showInfo('details');" onMouseOut="hideInfo('details');">What are the technical details?</a><BR>

<div id="need" class="tooltip">
<B>Requirements</B><BR>
<BR>
- Windows: probably a 'fast' Computer (>500 mhz) for a faster button response <BR>
- Linux: probably a 'slow' Computer and a Software Patch / Programming skills to adapt the Linux driver to your needs.<BR>
- Besides you just need an USB support :)
</div>

- <a onMouseOver="showInfo('need');" onMouseOut="hideInfo('need');">What do I need for 'The Claw'?</a><BR>


<div id="cheat" class="tooltip">
<B>Is 'The Claw' a cheat?</B><BR>
<BR>
Is a very fast Internet connection in a 3d FPS game a cheat? Well... you gain an advantage over your enemy...<BR>
But i prefer an other point of view. You can type in your commands faster, you improve the handling of the game, something the programmers should have done in the first place.<BR>
A good example is (as always :) StarCraft. Though the key assignment is not bad, it could be much better.
</div>

- <a onMouseOver="showInfo('cheat');" onMouseOut="hideInfo('cheat');">Is 'The Claw' a cheat?</a><BR>

<div id="badthings" class="tooltip">
<B>The bad things about 'The Claw'</B><BR>
<BR>
- You need some time to get around with 'The Claw'.<BR>
- 'The Claw' transmits its data fast, but sometimes (under windows) when using complex key combinations the software will forget some clicks... You have to insert a 100ms delay between the commands.<BR>
- It works for action and for RTS games, though very complex games (like StarCraft:Broodwar) need some tricky settings, as there are more commands than buttons.For example you need to put 'Build' and 'Barracks' on one button ("BB").<BR>
- there is no right-hand version
</div>
- <a onMouseOver="showInfo('badthings');" onMouseOut="hideInfo('badthings');">The drawbacks</a><BR>



<div id="why" class="tooltip">
<B>Why should I use 'The Claw'?</B><BR>
<BR>
Well, there are some tools like DoxStar that works like 'The Claw', but your hand still lies much more comfortable on 'The Claw' as it can on the keyboard...<BR>
In addition optimizing the complex configuration possibilities are fun and quite useful in a game.
</div>

- <a onMouseOver="showInfo('why');" onMouseOut="hideInfo('why');">Why should I use 'The Claw' instead a simple key-assign program?</a><BR>


<div id="useful" class="tooltip">
<B>Is it useful?</B><BR>
<BR>
All in all:<BR>
I played a lot with the keyboard and the claw.<BR>
I did not win more games, neither I lost more with the claw, but it was more fun and it is better for the hand. :)<BR>
Besides it looks better than a standard keyboard and leaves more space on the table.<BR>
</div>

- <a onMouseOver="showInfo('useful');" onMouseOut="hideInfo('useful');">So... it is useful?</a><BR>

- <a onMouseOver="showInfo('sample');" onMouseOut="hideInfo('sample');">How does a sample configuration look like?</a><BR>
<BR>

other Resellers: Look on <a href="http://www.claw.com.au">http://www.claw.com.au</a><BR>
That is the producer's homepage by the way (you canf find there my sample configuration for StarCraft, too :)<BR>
