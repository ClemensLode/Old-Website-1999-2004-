<B>StarCraft Calculator '03</B> : Hehe... Though I had not much time in 2002 (Final exams in school, start of studies) I learned some things about AI... Well I plan to implement them and create a final StarCraft Calculator. <BR>
<BR> 
<B>Parasite '02</B> : I programmed 'ramps and parasites'. The 'ramps' have to sort 12 digits while the 'parasites' represent the combination of digits. I will write an 'AI' Article about that later.<BR>
<BR>
<B>WarCraft Calculator '02</B> : WarCraft3... I really thought of it as an improved StarCraft... (as was StarCraft to WarCraft2). Well... see my comment to that in the <a href="whoami">WhoAmI</a> section.<BR>
Oh yes... the calculator. I started it but lost the motivation to complete it. :[<BR> 
<BR> 
<B>StarCraft Calculator '02</B> : I finally decided to reprogram it. Though it already works more or less, the algorithm it is very stupid. It only can make a certain build order faster.<BR>
I'm now trying to apply an evolving neural network on this problem, well this means for you that you have to wait a month or so longer :\.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Vor Calculator '01</B> : The successor of SCC, it is also based on GA and calculates the optimal army in the table-top game "VOR" (see 'downloads').<BR>
<BR>
<B>StarCraft Calculator '01</B> : A very nice and useful program that calculates the best build order to reach a certain amount of units (e.g. 6 Wraiths).
Unfortunately I lost the source code in a harddisk crash :\. But I will certainly reprogram it.<BR>
<BR>
<B>WARS '96-'99</B> : A (too) HUUUGE project (realtime strategy game with a huge economy system). Unfortunately it never made it behind resource gathering snakemen.<BR>
<BR> 
<B>ACTION! '95</B> : A nice the-enemies-flying-from-right-to-left-and-u-have-to-shoot-them-with-10-different-weapons-game.
Yes... *sigh* the good old Pascal and ModeX times.<BR>
<BR>
<B>It's Dark in the Dungeon '94</B> : It never made it behind the brainstorming phase probably because I lacked computer knowledge at that time ;)<BR>
