Yees, yes, no update a long time... Well... I worked hard :} <BR>
So here are the news:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Homepage</B><BR>
- Updated the Who Am I section to make it IE compatible<BR>
- removed some HTML Bugs<BR>
- added a 'Claw' review<BR>
- added some pictures, the 'error' pages (which are displayed when the site is not found)<BR>
- replaced some ads<BR>
- added some book reviews<BR>
<BR>
<B>StarCraftCalculator</B> <BR>
- aaah :) Finally the 1.02 version...<BR>
  There are still some things that I would like to add, but all in all it is complete.<BR>
  Look at the 'StarCalc' section :)<BR>
Soon, you will find there some videos, too :)<BR>
I made this picture to make better advertisement on some pages:<BR>
(Remember the first rule of making web site: At least one picture on each site)<BR>

Good News everyone! Another update :-)<BR>
I corrected some html and spelling errors, fixed up the meta tags and some invisible html stuff, optimized the homepage...
Currently I am writing on a Neural Network tutorial. It is pretty difficult to squeeze that huge theme into a readable and understandable format for beginners :-)<BR>
Especially the 'A Neural Network with Pen and Paper' part needs some rewriting and demonstration pictures.<BR>
But I am optimistic that this is done after the christmas holidays so be patient :)<BR>Oh yes... one last thing... As the Master of Orion 3 Release date is near there will be a nice re/overview in some weeks (yes, especially about the Artificial Intelligence)<BR> 

<br>
<B>12/1/02:</B><BR>
Hey hey <img src="../images/wave.gif"><BR>
<BR>
Finally... a new version of the homepage :)<BR>
There are still some minor things to do including adding more graphics and change the design on some pages (especially the ugly link page <img src="../images/grnwink.gif"><BR>
Yes... and the book section and and and... well, next update is I hope next weekend.
Well... but that's about it ;)<BR>
I hope you find something useful on this homepage...<BR>
