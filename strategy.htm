This article describes strategy in general.
I will demonstrate the techniques with the example 'StarCraft'.

Most of it will seem obvious but it is always good to keep the basics in mind.


Tech vs Rush

In every state of the game you can grade both players' attack and defense capability. In most times the defense capability is higher as you have defense structures like cannons, shield batteries, bunkers or sunken colonies. In addition the moment you move your troops together to attack you loose time as your newly produced troops cannot 'beam' directly to the frontier but have to take a more or less long way to help in the fight.

To put it alltogether: You have to be in a certain level of advantage concerning army size, upgrades and/or tech level.

Zerg A 		vs 	    Zerg B

Pool      		    4 Drones
6 Zerglings 		    Pool
Move Z. to Enemy 	    6 Zerglings

Well... now Zerg A has 6 Zerglings in the base of B but Zerg B completed 6 Zerglings in that moment, too.
Although Zerg A had 6 Zerglings a while before Zerg B had he is in a disadvantage now.

So when you decide to attack the enemy next time, do not look at what he has now, think about what he will have in 1-2 minutes!

That time factor applies to several areas. For example the Terran wallin.
What does a Terran wallin anyway? 
Well... basicly it blocks enemy units.
So it counts as if the enemy has send its units later. In addition it gives your ranged units behind the wall something like a range bonus: They can shoot more often before the enemy reaches the ranged unit to kill it.

Other examples are medics, scvs repairing units/buildings during battle etc.

Of course all these examples depends on the attacking units... You will have some problems against 10 Siegetanks attacking your wallin :) So the effectivness is not linear.

<Graph>?


Same goes for Armor...
Most players do not notice that small changes may have huge effects on the game.
Ever tried to attack photon cannons or sunken colonies with marines in the beginning of the game?
Yes ... 2 shots and your marine is down.
Add a vessel, find the single marine who is attacked (or send one marine first) and do defense matrix on him. The whole group of marines will last much longer.

Or: Do an Armor Upgrade. "Well..." you might say... "19 Damage instead of 20... so what's the point?" The point is that a marine has 40 Health Points and can withstand 3 instead of only 2 shots after the upgrade. It simply does not matter (in StarCraft at least...) whether a marine has 20 or 2 Health Points left. He still can do maximum damage.

There are other examples. Here a small list:

Marine 0/1 -> 3 instead of 2 Shots Dragoner / Sunken / Photon
Marine 0/3 -> 3 instead of 2 Shots Dragoner with 1 Damage upgrade
Marine 0/1 -> 2 instead of 1 Blow of a Dark Templar (! survives with 1 HP ;D)
Scourge 0/1 -> 2 instead of 1 Shot of Battle Cruiser (!!)
Zealot 1/0 -> 2 isntead of 3 Blows to kill a Zergling

That exists also the other way round when low-damage units meet high-armor units:
Marine -> Ultralisk
Zergling -> Ultralisk
