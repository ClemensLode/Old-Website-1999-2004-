First: Sorry, that the homepage was down and thank you that you are still visiting the site.<BR>
Second: In the moment I have big plans with the 'ClawSoftware' homepage concerning especially the new game
'WarCraft III'.<BR>
Though it's not out yet, I'm rewriting the old StarCraft Calculator to work with WarCraftIII, too.<BR>
A flash version of the page is also in work, so come back in a month or so.<BR>
