Mmmh... I tested the homepage in the 'Internet Explorer' from Microsoft.<BR>
Of course... it did not work properly.<BR>
Well, here are the updates:<BR>
- Updated the Who Am I section to make it IE compatible<BR>
- Added another chapter in the Artificial Intelligence section (Neural Networks!)<BR>
- removed some HTML Bugs<BR> 
<BR>


<B>12/15/02:</B><BR>
Good News everyone! Another update :-)<BR>
I corrected some html and spelling errors, fixed up the meta tags and some invisible html stuff, optimized the homepage...
Currently I am writing on a Neural Network tutorial. It is pretty difficult to squeeze that huge theme into a readable and understandable format for beginners :-)<BR>
Especially the 'A Neural Network with Pen and Paper' part needs some rewriting and demonstration pictures.<BR>
But I am optimistic that this is done after the christmas holidays so be patient :)<BR>Oh yes... one last thing... As the Master of Orion 3 Release date is near there will be a nice re/overview in some weeks (yes, especially about the Artificial Intelligence)<BR> 

<br>

Hey hey <img src="../images/wave.gif"><BR>
<BR>
Finally... a new version of the homepage :)<BR>
There are still some minor things to do including adding more graphics and change the design on some pages (especially the ugly link page <img src="../images/grnwink.gif"><BR>
Yes... and the book section and and and... well, next update is I hope next weekend.
Well... but that's about it ;)<BR>
I hope you find something useful on this homepage...<BR>
